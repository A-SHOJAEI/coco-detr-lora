# NOTE: We intentionally avoid `pycocotools` here. It often requires system Python headers
# (e.g. `python3.12-dev`) to compile native extensions, which breaks on minimal Ubuntu
# hosts. This repo’s default smoke pipeline uses a pure-Python COCO JSON loader and a
# lightweight evaluator so it runs in a repo-local venv without apt dependencies.

# Install this package itself (needed for `from coco_detr_lora import ...`)
